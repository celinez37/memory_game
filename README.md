## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[I watched videos on youtube and asked my friend to understand the basic components of web development.]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[When I started the prework, I am extremely confused about the basic component of building websites. I have no idea what is HTML, CSS, and javascript, therefore I had to go to youtube to understand their differences. I went to a friend that has learned front-end development before to seek help because I have no idea what I was doing initially with the instructions given. Through my friend's and youtube's explanations, I understand their differences. HTML is a file that contains the text, the overall format of the website, and how functions apply. For example, we included how the text and buttons to the site, which is the layout of the site. Moreover, we applied to sound to the light-up button. This is the format component of HTML. The js file includes all the functions we apply to the HTML file. Lastly, the CSS file that customs the HTML text and bottoms such as the text size, bottom color, and light up the color. I had a hard time understanding all these components because I never had experience with websites, so asking my friend for help and looking over youtube videos clears out my confusion easily because I found out that writing the functions in js was similar to java but just with a different language. Understanding the relationship solved my confusion on importing the guess function because I was initially lost with how to connect everything together and knowing what is supposed to be called since it should be focused on parts on the js file. Things went smoothly after because I understand the logic of how everything brings everything back to the HTML file and displays it out.]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[With regard to the game completed, it only contains one webpage. I am curious about how to connect multiple web pages together. For example, should we add more to the HTML, js, or CSS file to make that connection so that users can go back and forward? More importantly, I wonder how webpages are pop out if we included a hyperlink to the current built one. I am also curious if general users can access and change HTML in their current webpage. For example, if I am on the google website, can I change the HTML format and text that has already been set up? These all bring up my curiosity.]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[If I have more time on this project I would include clearer instructions because it is unclear for the user to understand what the game is doing with just two lines of text. This would also include a demo of the game so that it is clear visually and make it easy to understand. Next, I would add a color label so it would be more inclusive for people who aren't able to recognize color but still want to play the game. Lastly, I would add a scoreboard that includes the round number, so that it would be clearer for users to know which round they are in and the score they have received.]
